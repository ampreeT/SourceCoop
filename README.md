# SourceCoop

SourceCoop is a cooperative plugin for [Black Mesa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/ "Black Mesa") that __allows multiple players to play together on official and custom campaigns__. The plugin fixes various crashes, adjusts maps for cooperative play, re-enables single-player functionality, and __only needs to be installed on the server__.

## Installation Guide
__If you are someone who is looking to play on a server__, you are already completely set up and ready to play! Cooperative servers can be found on the server browser just like any other server.
